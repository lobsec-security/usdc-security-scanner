## Security Best Practices

When testing for vulnerabilities:

- **Do not** exploit vulnerabilities beyond what's necessary to demonstrate the issue
- **Do not** access, modify, or delete data that doesn't belong to you
- **Do not** perform actions that would degrade our services for other users
- **Do not** use automated scanning tools without prior written permission
- **Do** use test accounts and sandbox environments when available
- **Do** report findings promptly and clearly

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach:

1. **Private disclosure:** Vulnerability details are shared only between the reporter and LobSec
2. **Fix development:** We work to develop and deploy a fix
3. **Coordinated public disclosure:** After the fix is deployed, we will coordinate with the reporter for public disclosure
4. **Timeline:** We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of initial report

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research activities conducted in accordance with this policy to be authorized under applicable computer fraud laws. We will not initiate legal action against researchers who:

- Make good faith efforts to comply with this policy
- Do not engage in destructive testing or abuse
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond necessary demonstration
- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before a fix is deployed

## Acknowledgments

We appreciate the security research community's help in keeping LobSec safe. As our bug bounty program develops, responsible disclosure reporters may be eligible for recognition and rewards.
